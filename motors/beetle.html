        In this article, I'll explore one of my family's car restoration
        projects: a <b><abbr title="Volkswagen">VW</abbr> Beetle</b>. Although
        it has many other nicknames commonly used in different countries, for
        example <i lang="de">Käfer</i> in Germany (its home country), or
        <i lang="pt">Carocha</i> in Portugal, it was officially designated
        <b>Volkswagen Type 1</b>.

      <h3>Family Background</h3>
      <p>
        A long time ago, even before this car appeared in my family, it was my
        father, <span lang="pt">Inácio</span>, who took the first steps in this
        <em>tough</em> road.
      </p>
      <p>
        Born in the Portuguese countryside, near
        <span lang="pt">Serra da Estrela</span>, soon moved to the capital city,
        Lisbon, when with only 16 years old was looking for better life
        opportunities. There he started working in the garages of the national
        postal company
        (<abbr title="Correios e Telecomunicações de Portugal">CTT</abbr>), in
        the area of vehicles repair and maintenance, which became his life's
        profession until today.
      </p>
      <p>
        After almost a decade, with only the one and a half year exit to fulfill
        his military obligation, decided to emigrate to Canada with his brother.
        With this new reality, he continued to develop his craftship in the auto
        area, doing all the process from panel beater to paint job.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few years later, he met my mother and after a while, they got
        married. My brother, Nelson, was born in
        <time datetime="1985">1985</time> and within five years, well, it was my
        turn. The comeback to Portugal was always in their minds and in
        <time datetime="1993">1993</time>, we all settled down in a village in
        the center region of Portugal.
      </p>

          <span lang="pt">Serra da Estrela</span>, from my mom's eyes,
          <span lang="pt">Efigénia</span>. [<time datetime="1994">1994</time>]
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        In <time datetime="2001">2001</time>, after a few years working for
        others, my father had finally reunited the conditions to start his own
        business and build his autoshop.
      </p>
      <p>
        The passion for cars, particularly old ones, was already passed to the
        young generation, when my brother decided to left school and do a car
        painting specialization course.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our bonds got stronger by absorving and sharing the passion and legacy
        of the old man. We believe in family projects.
