          In this article, I'll explore one of my family's car restoration
          projects: a <b><abbr title="Volkswagen">VW</abbr> Beetle</b>. Although
          it has many other nicknames commonly used in different countries, for
          example <i lang="de">Käfer</i> in Germany (its home country), or
          <i lang="pt">Carocha</i> in Portugal, it was officially designated
          <b>Volkswagen Type 1</b>.

          <h3 class="beetle-inverse">Family Background</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          A long time ago, even before this car joined my family, it was my
          father, <span lang="pt">Inácio</span>, who took the first steps in
          this bumpy road.
        </p>
        <p>
          Born in the Portuguese countryside, near
          <span lang="pt">Serra da Estrela</span>, soon he moved to the capital
          city, Lisbon, at a very young age (16 years old) looking for better
          life opportunities. There he started working at the workshops of the
          national postal company
          (<abbr title="Correios e Telecomunicações de Portugal">CTT</abbr>), in
          vehicles repair and maintenance, which became his profession until
          today.
        </p>
        <p>
          After almost a decade in
          <abbr title="Correios e Telecomunicações de Portugal">CTT</abbr>,
          including eighteen months of military service, he decided to emigrate
          to Canada where his brother was living at the time. In this new
          reality, he continued to develop his craftsmanship, doing all the
          process from panel beater to paint job.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few years later, he met my mother and after a while, they got
          married. My brother, Nelson, was born in 1985 and after five years,
          well, it was my turn. The comeback to Portugal was always in their
          minds and, in 1993, we all settled down in a village in the center
          region of Portugal.

          In 2001, after a few years working for other employers, my father had
          finally reunited the conditions to start his own business and build
          his autoshop.
        </p>
        <p>
          The passion for cars, particularly old ones, had already been passed
          to the young generation and my brother just confirmed it, when he
          decided to leave school and do a car painting specialization course.

          <h3 class="beetle-inverse">Beetle's Journey</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          On a sunny Sunday in 2004, and after a brief research in the
          advertisement's section of the regional newspaper
          <cite lang="pt">Ocasião</cite>, which by that time was almost the only
          way to buy and sell cars in the country, me and my dad decided to
          embark on a small trip to <span lang="pt">Tomar</span>. There we found
          this old and rusty car parked in a barn. After a quick look, and since
          our idea had always been to do a full restoration, the main
          requirement for us wasn't to find a car in great conditions, but an
          interesting price instead. Therefore, we made a deal for &euro;600 and
          on that day we sent it to our autoshop.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first steps were, obviously, the entire <b>disassembly</b> of the
          car and, during that process, we discovered a lot of holes and rotten
          parts as a result of years of abandonment. One of the characteristics
          of these types of cars is the easy separation between the
          <b>chassis</b> and the <b>upper body</b>, which allowed us to do a
          better job by reaching and repairing some hidden parts. The
          <b>engine</b> was also dismantled, part by part, and upgraded from
          1300cc to <b>1600cc</b>. This specific work was done by some mechanic
          friends, who accompanied us in this multiyear journey. For their
          contribution and all the others who helped us keeping the motivation
          and focus on the job, we are very thankful.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
          As some parts were in an awful state, we had to purchase several
          pieces. From <b>fenders</b>, <b>headlights</b>, <b>door sills</b>, to
          small pieces of the <b>braking system</b>, <b>steering wheel</b>, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working only on the short free time available during almost 5 years,
          we had finally ended the first part of the restoration. Some time
          later, after painting and putting back everything in the car, we
          discovered an anomaly in the paint job. This was caused by the use of
          an <b>anticorrosive product</b>, which had been applied in the early
          stages of the <b>bare metal treatment</b>. And suddenly, we were in
          the middle of an unexpected thunderstorm.

          The project was suspended in the following years, not only because our
          motivation had been hit hard, but also those times of economic
          recession in Portugal didn't help at all. Meanwhile, our priorities
          had also changed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last chapter of the restoration was written over the last 2 years.
          We took a few steps back in the paint job, scratched almost the whole
          car and, especially, where that product was causing problems. Then, we
          treated it the best way possible. The final round took place in the
          first quarantine period of
          <abbr title="Coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr>, when we had more
          time to reach the end of this long road.

          In the end, our bonds just got stronger by absorbing and sharing the
          <em>passion</em> and <em>legacy</em> of the old man. We believe in
          family projects.
