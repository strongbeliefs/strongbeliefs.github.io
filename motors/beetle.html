        In this article, I'll explore one of my family's car restoration
        projects: a <b><abbr title="Volkswagen">VW</abbr> Beetle</b>. Although
        it has many other nicknames commonly used in different countries, for
        example <i lang="de">Käfer</i> in Germany (its home country), or
        <i lang="pt">Carocha</i> in Portugal, it was officially designated
        <b>Volkswagen Type 1</b>.

      <h3>Family Background</h3>
      <p>
        A long time ago, even before this car joined my family, it was my
        father, <span lang="pt">Inácio</span>, who took the first steps in this
        bumpy road.
      </p>
      <p>
        Born in the Portuguese countryside, near
        <span lang="pt">Serra da Estrela</span>, soon he moved to the capital
        city, Lisbon, at a very young age (16 years old) looking for better life
        opportunities. There he started working at the workshops of the national
        postal company
        (<abbr title="Correios e Telecomunicações de Portugal">CTT</abbr>), in
        vehicles repair and maintenance, which became his profession
        until today.
      </p>
      <p>
        After almost a decade, and fulfilling his military obligation for one
        and a half year within this period, he decided to emigrate to Canada
        with his brother. In this new reality, he continued to develop his
        craftsmanship, doing all the process from panel beater to paint job.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few years later, he met my mother and after a while, they got married.
        My brother, Nelson, was born in
        <time datetime="1985">1985</time> and after five years, well, it was my
        turn. The comeback to Portugal was always in their minds and, in
        <time datetime="1993">1993</time>, we all settled down in a village in
        the center region of Portugal.
      </p>

          My dad, brother and myself in
          <span lang="pt">Serra da Estrela</span>, from my mom's eyes,

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        In <time datetime="2001">2001</time>, after a few years working for
        someone else, my father had finally reunited the conditions to start his
        own business and build his autoshop.
      </p>
      <p>
        The passion for cars, particularly old ones, had already been passed to
        the young generation and my brother just confirmed it, when he decided
        to leave school and do a car painting specialization course.
      </p>
      <h3>Beetle's Journey</h3>
      <p>
        On a sunny Sunday in <time datetime="2004">2004</time>, and after a
        brief research in the advertisement's section of the regional newspaper
        <cite lang="pt">Ocasião</cite>, which by that time was almost the only
        way to buy and sell cars in the country, me and my dad decided to embark
        on a small trip to <span lang="pt">Tomar</span>. There we found this old
        and rusty car parked in a barn. After a quick look, and since our idea
        had always been to do a full restoration, the main requirement for us
        wasn't to find a car in great conditions, but an interesting price
        instead. Therefore, we made a deal for &euro;600 and on that day we sent
        it to our autoshop.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first steps were, obviously, the entire <b>disassembly</b> of the
        car and, during that process, we discovered a lot of holes and rotten
        parts resulted from years of abandonment. One of the characteristics of
        these types of cars is the easy separation between the <b>chassis</b>
        and the <b>upper body</b>, which allowed us to do a better job by
        reaching and repairing some hidden parts. The <b>engine</b> was also
        dismantled, part by part, and upgraded from 1300cc to <b>1600cc</b>.
        This specific work was done by some mechanic friends, who accompanied us
        in this multiyear journey. For their contribution and all the others who
        helped us keeping the motivation and focus on the job, we are very
        thankful.
      </p>

      <p>
        As some parts were in an awful state, we had to purchase several pieces.
        From <b>fenders</b>, <b>headlights</b>, <b>door sills</b>, to small
        pieces of the <b>braking system</b>, <b>steering wheel</b>, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working only on the short free time available during almost 5 years, we
        had finally ended the first part of the restoration. Some time later,
        after painting and putting back everything in the car, we discovered
        an anomaly in the paint job. This was caused by the use of an
        <b>anticorrosive product</b>, which had been applied in the early stages
        of the <b>bare metal treatment</b>. And suddenly, we were in the middle
        of an unexpected thunderstorm.

        The project was suspended in the following years, not only because our
        motivation had been hit hard, but also those times of economic recession
        in Portugal didn't help at all. Meanwhile, our priorities had also
        changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last chapter of the restoration was written over the last 2 years.
        We took a few steps back in the paint job, scratched almost the whole
        car and, especially, where that product was causing problems. Then, we
        treated it the best way possible. The final round took place in the
        first quarantine period of
        <abbr title="Coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr>, when we had more time
        to reach the end of this long road.

        In the end, our bonds just got stronger by absorbing and sharing the
        <em>passion</em> and <em>legacy</em> of the old man. We believe in
        family projects.
