        <p>
          According to ancient Greek philosophy, air is one of the four
          classical elements along with water, earth and fire. <b>Wind</b>, as
          the flow of air, is probably the most underrated by us, Humans.
          However, when some people see it as a <em>weakness</em>, others may
          see it as a <em>strength</em>. And that's exactly the case of our
          first guest and new friend, <i lang="pl">Julia</i>, who is a polish
          <b>sailor</b>, <b>coach</b> and <b>judge</b>.

          <h3 class="windy-inverse">Set Sail From Krakow</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          <i lang="pl">Julia</i> was born in Krakow (<i lang="pl">Kraków</i>),
          one of the oldest cities of Poland (<i lang="pl">Polska</i>), in 1997.
          She recalls, when she was an 8-year-old little girl, being by the
          Vistula (<i lang="pl">Wisła</i>) river and seeing <q>some boats</q>,
          while her father, <i lang="pl">Marcin</i>, asked her if she would like
          to try a new sport, sailing. Despite looking back and describing
          herself as a <q>very busy kid</q> with many additional activities,
          from piano and theater classes to swimming and English lessons, at
          that moment she just <q>didn't feel</q> like trying and that's why she
          <q>said no</q> to her father's suggestion. Her twin siblings,
          <i lang="pl">Klara</i> and <i lang="pl">Kuba</i>, who also became
          sailors at a very young age, were born this year, 2005.
        </p>
        <p>
          After one year, however, when <i lang="pl">Julia</i> was 9 years old,
          her father decided to have a different approach. <q>He just signed me
          up. He didn't even ask, actually! That's my dad's &lsquo;style&rsquo;.
          He just told me. I don't remember exactly now, but it was something
          also bugging me, like I felt I could try...</q>. Back then, she
          already appreciated her parents' educational purpose. <q>They always
          wanted to really educate us in many ways [...] and were always looking
          for different activities for us</q>. And she's thankful for that.
        </p>
        <p>
          She started learning how to sail in a <q>course for kids on
          vacation</q>, during the summer of 2006. In this sailing club based in
          the <i lang="pl">Bagry</i> lake, she met her first official coach,
          <i lang="pl">Grzegorz</i>. Although <i lang="pl">Julia</i> and her
          siblings were being helped by their father in the very beginning,
          because <q>he had some sailing experience</q>, they <q>knew that Mr.
          (<i lang="pl">Pan</i>) <i lang="pl">Grzegorz</i> is the greatest one
          for the basics</q>. Even if she and her coach <q>only met in the
          clubs</q> for the trainings and regattas, an enormous admiration and
          respect for <q><i lang="pl">Pan Grzegorz</i></q> grew over time.
        </p>

          <p>
            &ldquo;He is absolutely marvelous! He is super patient with kids,
            super calm. I never saw him angry, never! Never shouting! I mean,
            coaches shout due to the wind, the water... but he never shouted at
            me or any other kid, because of anger, never! He is, seriously, the
            greatest one.&rdquo;
