          Today is finally the day that
          <b>Strong Beliefs</b> comes alive and I'm glad for it! For now, it’s
          still a demo project under development, but I think it’s already
          something to start building on!
        </p>

      <p>
        It represents the last few months of full commitment and a lot of
        enthusiasm, while I’ve been exploring a whole new world for me called
        <b>Web Development</b>. Like everything new we want to learn, we should
        start with the basics and that’s precisely what I did. More
        specifically, I’ve been focused on learning the 3 foundational front-end
        technologies:
        <b><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr></b>,
        <b><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></b> and
        <b>JavaScript</b>. I know it’s still a long road to become an expert,
        but step by step and especially with the high motivation I have right
        now, I truly believe I'll achieve my goals.

        This first article serves as a preface to explain what is coming and
        also to describe this project's background.

        It all started a year ago when I was studying Civil Engineering.
        A month after the beginning of that second academic semester, around the
        middle of March, there was a programming project to develop for a course
        called <span class="italic">Computational Mathematics</span>. Although I
        wasn't particularly enthusiastic about it because I hadn't programmed
        for a while, I ended up choosing the <b>MATLAB</b> language and
        searching for an up-to-date book to review some syntax details already
        forgotten. And it was at this very moment that <em>everything</em>
        changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the first time in my academic journey, I felt like the <em>more</em>
        I read and rediscovered the language itself, the <em>more</em> I wanted
        to know and learn. It was undoubtedly an indescribable and totally
        unexpected feeling! It made me think a lot about what I <em>really</em>
        wanted to do, but in the end the choice was pretty easy to make:
        <em>change</em> and follow my heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then it has been a very challenging and rewarding adventure! First,
        I decided to take an online specialization on automation using
        <b>Python</b>
        (<a class="beginnings-inverse"
            href="https://coursera.org/share/641e219cce410fc8db39c4a587a2166e"
            target="_blank"><cite>Google IT Automation with Python</cite></a>,
        developed by Google) to improve my programming skills. As I got more
        curious about this new language, I decided to buy my first book about it
        in order to gain a deeper understanding of its features.
      </p>
      <p>
        A couple of months later, as I was exploring more of this
        <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> universe, I finally came
        across Web Development and more, specifically, the front-end side. I
        found it absolutely fascinating and it was obvious to me that the path
        I was following was leading me to become a
        <b>Front-end Developer</b> sooner or later. Well, then a new cycle began
        and my motivation never stopped growing! More and more books have joined
        me and, meanwhile, I've also started a new program
        (<a class="beginnings-inverse"
            href="https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/w3cx-front-end-web-developer"
            target="_blank"><cite>Front-End Web Developer</cite></a>,
        designed by the
        <a class="beginnings-inverse" href="https://www.w3.org"
           target="_blank"><cite><abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr></cite></a>)
        and, unsurprisingly, about those front-end technologies I've mentioned
        before.

        In short, this project intends to put into practice some of the
        knowledge I've been acquiring so far. As more content is added and my
        learning curve expands, it will be updated with new features and,
        eventually, better solutions.
